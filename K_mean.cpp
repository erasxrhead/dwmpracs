/*
K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Learning algorithm, which groups the unlabeled dataset
into different clusters. Here K defines the number of pre-defined clusters that need to be created
in the process, as if K=2, there will be two clusters, and for K=3, there will be three clusters, and
so on.
The k-means clustering algorithm mainly performs two tasks:
o Determines the best value for K center points or centroids by an iterative process.

o Assigns each data point to its closest k-center. Those data points which are near to the particular k-
center, create a cluster.

Hence each cluster has datapoints with some commonalities, and it is away from other clusters.
The working of the K-Means algorithm is explained in the below steps:
Step-1: Select the number K to decide the number of clusters.
Step-2: Select random K points or centroids. (It can be other from the input dataset).
Step-3: Assign each data point to their closest centroid, which will form the predefined K clusters.
Step-4: Calculate the variance and place a new centroid of each cluster.
Step-5: Repeat the third steps, which means reassign each datapoint to the new closest centroid of
each cluster.
Step-6: If any reassignment occurs, then go to step-4 else go to FINISH.
Step-7: The model is ready.
